## Top N List

* [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)

*Start Here!* I still think this is "The Guide" to being a professional software engineer. Practical advice you can use daily to make you and those you work with more effective.

* [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/)

Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob) is a prolific author and speaker. He has a number of "Clean" books but this is the original. It digs into the details of how to write readable and maintainable (clean) code. You're future self will thank you for applying what you learn from this book.

* [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/)

This is the natural follow-up to Uncle Bob's Clean Code book. It steps back and looks at how all that code relates and how to keep the design flexible. This is the book he introduces the SOLID principles, which should be a tool in every dev's belt.

* [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0134757599/)

_“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”_
–M. Fowler (1999)

The list of "code smells" will give you a vocabulary for working with others as you identify problem areas in your code base.

* [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented/dp/149207800X/)

It's not the Gang of Four book but it is one of the better paths to getting acquainted with and introducing Design Patterns to your work.

* [Extreme Programming Explained](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658/)

This is the original developers book for Agile. How a group of engineers applied it to their work and how all the parts fit together. Somewhere along the way we started treating agile as if it were only a project management methodology and we left all the development practices behind.
